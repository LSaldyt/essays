**THEME**

What is this illusive thing called theme? In a general sense, a theme
can be thought of as a *topic*. Songs have topics; movies have topics. A
theme of a love song, in a general sense, would be…love. Love would also
be a general theme for *Romeo and Juliet*, for example.

When dealing with literature, you can go deeper, and be more specific,
with theme. Think more along the lines of *author’s message*. (Note,
then, that a theme is not a moral. An author isn’t *telling* you how you
should live, what you *should* or *shouldn’t* do, what’s right or
wrong.)

> A few steps to help figure out theme:

1.  Start with character.

2.  What are that character’s concerns, obstacles, or desires?

3.  How does that character fulfill his or her desires, or overcome his
    or her obstacles? Or, how and why does that character fail to
    fulfill those desires, or overcome those obstacles?

4.  Use key words and phrases from your answers to 2 and 3 to get an
    idea of what the author is saying about *human behavior*.

Using *Romeo and Juliet* again, then, the author isn’t saying that you
should stab yourself if you ever wake up to find your girlfriend or
boyfriend poisoned beside you. Shakespeare **isn’t telling** you to do
anything. What he is saying, in the larger, more *universal* sense is
that *a life without true love isn’t worth living*. Or*, true love often
requires great risk and sacrifice.*

Note here that every story can have more than one theme. Students can
see this when they each have different answers to numbers two and three
above. As they think and write about theme, they should see that they
are using the specifics of the story, of the *plot*, to look outward, to
generalize, to get at a *universal truth*. In that way, themes apply to
us all.

Discerning theme from the short story, “Two Kinds”

1.  Main character: Jing-Mei

2.  **What does she care about?** She cares about, at first, pleasing
    her mother and going along with becoming a prodigy, but soon that
    changes; she’d rather not try at something and hope her mother gives
    up on her.

3.  **What does she do?** She determines not to try. She consciously, or
    subconsciously, sabotages her own efforts when practicing the piano,
    only to feel the sting of failure when she performs in front of
    an audience. Why would she do this? Why would any of us?

4.  **Author’s message/universal truth:** We often find ourselves of two
    minds, at odds with ourselves in that, though we may desire success,
    we at times sabotage our own efforts in order to give ourselves a
    built-in excuse to ease the pain in case of failure.
