**THEME**

\

What is this illusive thing called theme? In a general sense, a theme
can be thought of as a topic. Songs have topics; movies have topics. A
theme of a love song, in a general sense, would be…love. Love would also
be a general theme for *Romeo and Juliet*, for example.

When dealing with literature, you can go deeper, and be more specific,
with theme. Think more along the lines of author’s message. (Note, then,
that a theme is not a moral. An author isn’t *telling* you how you
should live, what you *should* or *shouldn’t* do, what’s right or
wrong.)

A few steps to help figure out theme:

\

1.  2.  3.  4.

Using *Romeo and Juliet* again, then, the author isn’t saying that you
should stab yourself if you ever wake up to find your girlfriend or
boyfriend poisoned beside you. Shakespeare **isn’t telling** you to do
anything. What he is saying, in the larger, more *universal* sense is
that *a life without true love isn’t worth living*. Or*, true love often
requires great risk and sacrifice.*

Note here that every story can have more than one theme. Students can
see this when they each have different answers to numbers two and three
above. As they think and write about theme, they should see that they
are using the specifics of the story, of the *plot*, to look outward, to
generalize, to get at a universal truth. In that way, themes apply to us
all.
