# Random collection of writing-related material

Not in this repository is the proprietary "Sense of Style," by Steven Pinker of Yale, Harvard, etc.
However, this guide has been one of the best resources on writing that I have found.

The other markdown files in this repository are some tips from my old high school english teacher on analyzing themes in short stories.  

More materials may perhaps be added with time.
