**HOW TO WRITE AN ANALYTICAL ESSAY**

1.  Before starting any paper, figure out theme. All roads of your
    paper, so to speak, should lead to theme. Figure out theme either
    through character (specifically a character’s concerns and actions)
    or through recurring motifs. These will probably overlap. Come up
    with a general theme statement that reflects what happens in the
    story as well as universal truths about human nature. Remember:
    theme addresses author’s message about human behavior, NOT what we
    (or the character) *should* or *shouldn’t* do in life. Don’t
    moralize to your readers. This theme statement often could function
    as the last sentence of your paper—this is where you are taking the
    reader, what you have shown/proven all along in your paper.

2.  Use the *idea* you came up with in your theme and incorporate it in
    different words into your thesis. Remember: a thesis is a
    combination of subject (plot) and opinion (theme). Your thesis will
    most likely be your last sentence in your intro paragraph. It is
    character/story specific, *not* about *people* in general.

3.  It is vital that your topic sentences of your body paragraphs
    include some opinion, something that the rest of your paragraph is
    going to support or prove. And again, these opinions somehow tie
    into your overall theme statement that you first came up with.
    Remember, too, to include quotations that support your
    points/opinions, and that those quotes NEED to be properly cited and
    attributed to someone. Example: Forrest illustrates his existential
    views on life when he says, “Life is like a box of chocolates; you
    never know what you’re gonna get” (132).

4.  Be brief in your summary/conclusion paragraph. Never repeat (copy
    and paste) something you’ve already said. In your last sentence try,
    whenever possible, to take your reader outside the story, into the
    realm of universal truth. This is where your general theme statement
    comes into play, with words like one, or everyone, or people, or at
    least without reference to any specific character in the story.
    Example from *Romeo and Juliet*: Life without true love is not
    worth living.

5.  Adhere to formal essay writing rules (see below) unless
    told otherwise. For example, write in present tense, using third
    person (no I, you, we, us). Write for a reader who does NOT know
    the story. When you introduce or refer to a character, you need to
    explain to the reader who that character is with appositives. DO
    give your paper a creative title (not the same as the author’s) but
    DO NOT punctuate it, bold it, underline it or give it any crazy font
    or size or color.

**GENERAL ESSAY RULES & TIPS**

1.  Create your *own* title that hints at theme. The Great Gatsby is not
    *your* title. Don’t punctuate your own titles in any way, *no*
    **bolding**, or supersizing fonts.

2.  Thesis: your thesis needs to include plot and theme elements (or
    subject and opinion). Therefore, you need to have a good handle on a
    theme before you can come up with a thesis.

3.  Discuss theme *without* mentioning the word “theme.”

4.  Topic sentences: need to be *broad enough* to cover everything that
    you are going to mention in the paragraph. *They should contain
    opinion* that relates to your thesis. A topic sentence that is just
    plot is too limiting and leaves you with nothing to prove in
    your paragraph. Your thesis should be based on the story, characters
    in the story, NOT on people in general.

5.  Quotations: Need at least one (preferably two) in all your
    *body* paragraphs. (Best not to have in conclusion paragraphs.) You
    need to **introduce** your quotations, **attribute** them, and
    **cite** them so that the reader knows who’s speaking, when and/or
    why he or she is saying what he or she is saying, and why it is
    relevant to your paragraph. Example: As Sherlock says to Watson as
    they’re standing over the corpse, “This man is dead” (12).
    \[**Please** take careful note of where the quotation marks and the
    spaces are.\] After a quotation, you **don’t** have to say: This
    quote shows…

6.  Conclusions: No new information goes in a conclusion paragraph.
    Summarize your points first, then take the reader out of the story
    and into the general, universal truths that your theme/thesis has
    been pointing at all along. DO NOT moralize, do not say what people,
    or the characters *should* or *should not* do based on what we’ve
    seen characters in the story do.

7.  Avoid vague words (very, good, thing, etc.) and wordy
    phrases, repetition. Ex: Throughout the novel, all of the
    characters, etc.

8.  Be very careful that your pronouns correspond correctly with
    your nouns. A *person*, or *one*, is a singular noun and does not
    correspond with *they* or *their*. You must use his or her.

9.  Be careful with definite articles. Using “the” assumes the reader
    knows what you are referring to. *An* affair vs. *the* affair in
    *Gatsby*.

10. Use formal style and language (no slang) unless told otherwise. Use
    **third** person (no I, you, we, us). Stay in **present** tense. Do
    not shift tenses. (Note to self: *was* is past tense).
